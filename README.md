# Hi, This is a simple comandline tool for scaffolding a rezact app

## Steps

To get this to work, you need to first clone the repo, depending on your client, i.e git or Github cli, you use the following command

#### GIT

> git clone <repo_url>

#### GITHUB CLI

> gh repo clone <repo_url>

CD into directory and install dependencies using your preferred package manager 

> pnpm install
>
> npm install
>
> yarn install

Whilst in the directory install package globally using

> npm install -g .

after that  cd to your desktop and run

> create-rezact-app <dirname>

that's all.
